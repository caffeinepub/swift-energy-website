  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented: the + button opens only the PIN dialog; correct PIN then opens an Options dialog; Add/Remove dialogs are opened only upon selecting the respective option, with the add option named “Add a Newspaper”. REQ-2/REQ-3 are largely implemented via frontend date validation + conversion to a bigint timestamp and backend storing the provided timestamp instead of Time.now(). However, the backend publish API now requires a timestamp parameter (not optional), which may miss the “optional/backward-compatible” aspect called out in REQ-3.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Backend publish method supports receiving the intended time value from the frontend (optionally) while remaining compatible with existing callers/records.",
      "reason": "The backend publish method signature was changed to require a timestamp parameter (timestamp : Time.Time) rather than accepting an optional timestamp or defaulting when not provided. This may break compatibility for any existing callers that still call the older publish method without a timestamp.",
