  "summary": "Diff adds a backend removeNews method and a frontend React Query mutation hook (useRemoveNews), plus substantial NewsPage state/handlers for PIN-gated Options and a remove workflow. However, backend deletion is implemented by title rather than an unambiguous/deterministic identifier (e.g., timestamp), which does not meet REQ-5’s determinism criterion. Several UI acceptance details (exact titles/labels, absence of date autofill icon/button, presence/location of date-format helper text, and remove selector UI) cannot be fully verified from the truncated NewsPage diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Backend actor exposes a new update method to remove a specific news item deterministically (using an unambiguous identifier such as the news timestamp).",
      "reason": "The backend removal method removes by `title : Text`, which is not an unambiguous/deterministic identifier (multiple items can share a title) and will remove all matching titles rather than a single specific item.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (public shared func removeNews(title : Text) ... news.title != title)",
        "frontend/src/hooks/useNews.ts (useRemoveNews mutationFn takes title: string and calls actor.removeNews(title))"
