There are also unrelated changes (Internet Identity hook) and an added project_state.json file not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "Although the innovations array includes an `image` field with the required `/assets/...` paths, the diff excerpt is truncated before the Card rendering and does not provide evidence that images are actually rendered next to the text, that the layout is responsive as specified, or that `alt` text is set on the images.",
