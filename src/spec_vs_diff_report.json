  "summary": "The diff introduces an explicit reducer-driven flow state machine (CLOSED → PIN → OPTIONS → ADD/REMOVE) and updates NewsPage handlers to start the flow with the PIN dialog only, transition to an Options dialog on correct PIN, and prevent Enter-key propagation from auto-triggering other actions. Based on the provided diff summary, the core requested interaction/flow changes appear implemented.",
