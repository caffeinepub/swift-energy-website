  "summary": "Swift Energy Website is a React + Tailwind single-page website for the Swift Energy LEGO robotics competition team. It provides public, mostly static informational pages (Home, About, Innovations, History) with consistent layout/navigation and rich content sections (cards, timelines, image banners). The codebase also includes optional Internet Identity authentication and ICP actor-creation helpers (likely from a template) plus a Motoko blob-storage mixin module for Caffeine/ICP storage operations (authorization via gateway principals, dead-blob pruning, and cycles refills), though the main backend actor is currently empty and the frontend does not actively fetch backend data.",
